# Your answer to the questions (no comment means correct)
+ Q1
+ Q2
+ Q3
+ Q4 "state during backward pass" > no, it's the gradient of the objective function wrt the state.
+ Q5 Gradient clipping
+ Q6
+ Q7 What do you feed in as gradOutput? From code I see you do it right.

# Comments on your code
Your query_sentences() only feeds in one character, that's not gonna go anywhere.
No need to flush that often :)
Your implementation of momentum looks incorrect, you need to keep a separate momentum vector.
But I appreciate that you tried momentum.

# Comments on your write-up
That validation perplexity of 286 is very surprising/suspicious, as training is at 458.
Could only be explained by way too high dropout or more likely a bug.
